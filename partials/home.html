			<p>The value of money, like the value of products and services, is determined by the demand for it. There are three methods of measuring the dollar's value. The first is how much foreign currency the dollar will purchase. That's the measure of the exchange rate. The foreign exchange market's forex traders determine exchange rates. They take supply and demand into consideration, and then factor in their future expectations. The value of cash fluctuates throughout the day of trading for this purpose. <br><br>The second technique is the value of notes from the Treasury. They can readily be transformed into dollars through Treasury secondary market. <br><br>The third way is through deposits of foreign currency. That's the quantity of overseas entities holding the dollar. The supply of dollar is based on the currency held by foreign governments and that makes cash from the U.S. more valuable. The value of the dollar would crash if foreign countries were to sell all their dollars and the Treasury holdings. And thus, the value of the US dollar would be worth less, according to Kimberly Amadeo as posted in thebalance website.</p>

			<p>Genetically Engineered foods have their DNA altered by making use of genes from other animals or plants. This is possible when scientists take the desired gene trait from a plant or animal and then insert it into the cell of another animal or plant. <br><br>Genetic engineering of foods is different than selective breeding. This first involves identifying the desired traits from animals or plants and later breeding them. The benefits of genetic engineering include nutritious and tastier food. The crops are disease and drought resistant that require lesser resources and pesticides. There is an increased supply of food with faster growing plants and animals. Moreover, there are medicinal foods that can be used for vaccines.<br><br> However, some concerns about GE foods include those that can cause an allergic reaction or unexpected genetic changes. There is also the issue of some foods being less nutritious, according to medlineplus.</p>

			<p>The world population is increasing at a slower rate, but it is still significantly growing. The world is currently adding around 83 million individuals per year, which is approximately equal to Germany's population. But population development has slowed from 1.24% a decade ago to 1.18% per year.<br><br> It is anticipated that Africa will more than double its population by 2100. Africa presently represents 16 percent of the world's population. The UN expects this ratio to increase to 25% by 2050 and 49% by 2100.<br><br> China and India will see their population increase to 1.4 billion by 2022. Following which, China's population is said to remain steady as people age but India's population is said to grow to 1.5 billion in 2030 and 1.7 billion by year 2050, according to a report by Washington Post.</p>
